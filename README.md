# Trinkets

A personal visual gallery that pulls images from an [Are.na](https://www.are.na/) channel and displays them in an animated rotating carousel.

Built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS and [GSAP](https://gsap.com/) (Draggable, InertiaPlugin, MotionPathPlugin, Flip).

## Setup

Open `index.html` in your browser or deploy to a static host. Edit `config.js` to point at a different Are.na channel.
